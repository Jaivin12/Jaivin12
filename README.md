- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jaivin
About Me,

  I am an MSc Artificial Intelligence student with a strong passion for technology, data analysis, and the stock market. My journey in coding is relatively new, but I am actively learning and implementing projects in Python, machine learning, and deep learning. I have experience working on projects such as stock price prediction, image classification, and sensor-based systems.
I am also pursuing entrepreneurial aspirations in the organic product manufacturing industry, focusing on areas such as marketing, human resources, and budgeting. With my solid knowledge of the stock market and a keen interest in problem-solving, I aim to contribute to innovative and impactful projects in the field of AI and finance.
Feel free to connect with me for collaboration, learning, or sharing insights on AI, finance, and entrepreneurship
